## SIDE 

SIDE makes Sublime just a bit more useful.
The goal of SIDE is to mimic LSP features without language servers and without any protocol. It uses only the things that are already in Sublime.

How is that even possible?
Well SIDE is smart as much as you are. 
You can be the best or the worst language server. That depends on you. 
SIDE will just try to help as much as it can.
